**Changelog**
---
Please see Changes.md


**How to use**
---
- Get game somehow and make sure it will run properly. (DO NOT ASK ANYTHING THAT IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE GAME IT SELF)
- Download [latest version of MaiDXR](https://github.com/xiaopeng12138/MaiDXR/releases)
- Download and install [com0com](https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive-downloads/v2/code.google.com/powersdr-iq/setup_com0com_W7_x64_signed.exe)
- Configure com0com to bind COM3 and COM5 (it must be these two ports), COM4 and COM6 is optional (bind them will make your startup process faster).
- You must enable the enable buffer option in com0com on both ports of all pairs. Otherwise, your MaiDXR will crash after the logo.
- Disable DummyTouchPanel in mai2.ini.
- If you need button light, pls bind COM21 to COM51 (it must be these two ports)(Do not disable DummyLED!).
- Run the game in window mode by adding [Unity Standalone Player command line arguments](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PlayerCommandLineArguments.html) in xxxxx.bat and make sure there is no black bar. Recommend setting for 1080p display: "xxxxxx.exe -screen-fullscreen 0 -screen-width 1170 -screen-height 1050"
- Start MaiDXR first then start the game.
- If your touch is not working, try to enable somehow Test mod then exit Test mode.


**Configuration**
---
The green button on the bottom of the cabinet is lock button. Long press it will disable all unnecessary buttons, controller pointer, and the config panel.

You can adjust all settings in the config panel or via config.json. The changes of config.json will only apply after the MaiDXR reboot. 

If you want to adjust the settings, please take a step back. The controller pointer will automatically be disabled when the controller are too close to the cabinet.

Some configs in config.json are only the index of the dropdown.

You can use the pointer to point the third-person camera and grab it to the position where you want to be.

**Multiplayer Configuration**
---
All the settings related to multiplayer are inside config.json.

- **HostIP:** IP address of the host to be connected by the client, supports IPV4/6. IPV6 format: **HostIP: "[fe80::1145:1400:1919:8100]"** 
- **HostPort:** the port of the host, also the port to which the client will connect. The protocol is UDP.
- If you need to forward the port on top of the router, you only need to forward one of the above UDP ports.

**EncoderSetting:**
- **bitRate:** bit rate (unit: bit; default: 196608)
- **frameRate:** frame rate (in FPS; default: 24)
- **maxFrameSize:** maximum single frame size (unit: bit; default: 8192)
- **ResolutionDivider:** Reduce the encoding resolution, i.e. the input window screen resolution. Does not affect the local display. Inputting 2 will divide the window's width and height by 2. (default: 2)

**Too high bit rate and resolution will cause all kinds of lag and issues, it is recommended to divide the resolution by 3 and adjust the frame rate to less than 20 fps, which can solve the problem of compression mosaic and encoding lag to some extent.**
